# GoogleAppRating-Analysis
**This data analysis project covers the below points**:
* 1. Import dataset from Kaggle.
* 2. Using Pandas and Numpy to transform and clean data.
* 3. Calculate statistics and interpret meaning of data.
* 4. Using matplotlib and seaborn library to create visualizations.

## Notice: 
This is only the first part of the project, so I mainly focused on the EDA. In the second part of the project, I will explore what factors affect the rating of apps.
